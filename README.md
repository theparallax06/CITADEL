**Team:** THE PARALLAX  
**Smart India Hackathon 2026 — SIH26051**  
**Problem Statement:** Software Based Model Development for Design of Area Specific Shelter for Thermal Comfort Maintenance  
**Organization:** DRDO – Department of Defence R&D  
**Category:** Software

## 1. Overview

CITADEL is an area-specific shelter design and thermal evaluation platform that connects local climate conditions with parametric shelter design and physics-based thermal analysis.

It enables users to evaluate how **materials, geometry, insulation, openings, orientation, occupancy, and environmental conditions** influence shelter thermal behaviour. The platform follows an **offline-first** approach for remote and connectivity-constrained environments.

### Workflow

Location → Climate → Shelter Requirements → Parametric Design
→ Thermal Physics → Evaluation → Comparison → Optimization
→ Final Design → Engineering Report
```

## 2. Problem Context

Generic shelter designs may not adequately account for regional climatic conditions. Variations in **ambient temperature, solar radiation, humidity, orientation, material properties, insulation, dimensions, and openings** can significantly affect indoor thermal conditions.

CITADEL addresses this through a location-aware, physics-based workflow for evaluating shelter configurations under defined environmental conditions, supporting passive thermal design and reduced dependence on external heating and cooling systems.

## 3. Proposed Solution

Users can configure location, climate parameters, shelter dimensions, materials, insulation, openings, orientation, occupancy, and design constraints. Candidate configurations are evaluated using the thermal engine and compared to support data-driven design decisions.

## 7. Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm
- Git
- Android Studio + Android SDK — for Android development
- JDK 17 — for Android builds

Verify:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
java --version
```

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_FOLDER>
npm install
```

---

## 8. Web Application

Start development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite, normally:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Production files are generated in `dist/`.

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## 9. PWA / Offline Deployment

CITADEL uses **Vite PWA** functionality for offline-capable deployment.

```bash
npm run build
```

The core offline workflow uses cached application assets and local persistence rather than requiring continuous network connectivity.

---

## 10. Android Application

CITADEL can be packaged using **Capacitor**.

If Android has not been added:

```bash
npx cap add android
```

After frontend changes:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

Run the project from Android Studio on a connected device or emulator.

### Build APK

From the project root:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

**Windows**

```powershell
cd android
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

APK output:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Android Notes

Use **JDK 17** and ensure the required Android SDK components are installed. Location features require appropriate Android permissions. GPS and sensor accuracy depend on the device and environment.

## 11. Thermal Evaluation Model

CITADEL uses a **1D RC thermal network model** for comparative shelter evaluation.

The model considers:

- Shelter envelope
- Material thermal properties
- Thermal resistance and capacitance
- Ambient conditions
- Solar heat gain
- Openings
- Occupancy/internal conditions

Outputs include:

- Indoor temperature
- Solar heat gain
- Heat-flow behaviour
- Time-dependent thermal response

The current thermal engine is intended for **comparative design evaluation and exploration**.

---

## 12. Machine Learning Layer

The ML surrogate layer is intended to accelerate repeated thermal prediction during design-space exploration.

It learns relationships between relevant environmental/design parameters and thermal responses, allowing candidate configurations to be evaluated more rapidly.

Before reporting model performance, the ML model should be assessed using training, validation, and held-out test data. Suitable regression metrics include **R², MAE, RMSE, and MAPE**.

No unverified accuracy value is claimed in this repository.

---

## 13. Optimization

The design space can include:

- Dimensions
- Geometry
- Orientation
- Material combinations
- Insulation
- Openings
- Other design constraints

CITADEL supports **multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II** for exploring feasible thermal-design alternatives and associated trade-offs.

---

## 14. 3D Visualization

The shelter configuration is represented using:

- **Three.js**
- **React Three Fiber**
- **Drei**

The 3D layer provides an interactive representation of shelter geometry alongside thermal evaluation results.

---

## 15. Offline-First Architecture

Offline-oriented components include:

- Cached application assets
- Local climate/design data
- LocalStorage persistence
- Saved design history
- Offline PDF report generation
- Device-based location and orientation

This architecture is intended for remote and connectivity-constrained environments.

---

## 16. Validation

The CITADEL thermal engine provides a physics-based engineering estimate for comparative shelter design and thermal evaluation.

**ANSYS** can be used as an independent validation environment for selected 3D shelter geometries and thermal cases. Results from the simplified model can be compared with detailed numerical simulation for selected configurations.

ANSYS is a validation/reference environment, not a runtime dependency of the core application.
